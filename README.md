# Overview

I created a C++ program to create a simple calculator capable of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing any two real numbers. I wrote this to both learn the syntax of c++ as well as further my knowledge on the software development process. A major focus of building this program was to understand error handling. The program should be immune to user-error, as there are several error exceptions and string manipulation methods used to modify and fix user error, or prompt the user to input in the proper format.

# Development Environment

My language of choice was C++, compiled in the Visual Studio IDE. The program included the iostream (input/output), string, and vector libraries. These libraries allowed me to use the string and vector data types and containers.

# Future Work

- First I could include additional operations to improve the calculator's capabilities, such as modulus (%) or power(^) operators.  
- I could also account for several numbers at once, ie. an expression such as 12 + 6 - 4
- An order of operations system would also need to be included, so that expressions like 12 - 3 * 4 can be properly calculated, accounting for the * operator first.
